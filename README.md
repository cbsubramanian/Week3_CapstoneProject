The assignment is tricky to get it right first time itself but very good learning experience. The project is split for some reason into three parts and requested to be submitted as three parts too. Hence we have # Week3_CapstoneProject_Part1, Part2, Part3 as assignments. Please note each python notebook is an incremental update to the previous named version due to that. 
I suggest to redo the labs again and again that way doing this project will be easy. Please install first itself the libraries to use beautifulsoup package using the below commands. 
!pip install beautifulsoup4
!pip install lxml

Also for getting the coordinates from google try running the updated version like below. geopy first time did not work for me. 
#!conda install -c conda-forge geopy --yes 
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim # module to convert an address into latitude and longitude values
