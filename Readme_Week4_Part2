Introduction : (BUSINESS PROBLEM)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My brother with his family has come to stay with me. His family is completely new to the country and 
they are used to living in India. Their comfort zone is totally different in India and they have challenges 
to adapt to the new neighborhood. He currently plans to live and work in New York with his primary job. 
He and his wife plan to start a side business which his wife can run. They want to open an Indian restaurant 
in New York as more and more people are now migrating from bay area to this neighborhood. This is an opportunity 
to establish a business in this new neighborhood. The break down is below. 

NEAR SCHOOLS: His kids and my kids who are of same age group can go to same school and being new to the 
country and educational system, this will help a lot if we choose the location of the restaurant closer 
to schools. Catering to business needs and school pick up/drop would be easy that way.

LESS COMMUTE: His wife is still learning to drive. If the neighborhood caters to both driving less and 
also establishing a restaurant business it will benefit. So public transport should be available too.

NEAR PARK & GROCERY SHOPS: It needs to be closer to grocery shops and parks for a reason. People might 
be going to park and might decide to eat out which will benefit the business instead of being in a busy high 
traffic area. Parking could be a hassle amidst high traffic. But a park nearby might help people to take out and sit in the park and eat.

POPULATION: If the neighborhood is densely populated then the business can thrive easily.

Most importantly the location needs to be something where there are not many Indian cuisines present. 
That way the competition can be managed. The above four points need to be considered for making this business 
proposal a thriving long term successful venture.

MAIN FOCUS should be on finding a suitable location for opening the Indian restaurant cuisine around New York area.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE: My focus is to recommend using this project assignment which neighborhood is more suitable for my brother
and family to start the Indian restaurant business in New York.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TARGET AUDIENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone who is interested in opening an Indian restaurant in Manhattan NewYork neighborhood can go thru this project. 
The code can be modified although not fully perfect (production version) to the needs of individual. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Few things to note with respect to code: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code for extracting data from Foresquare API for different business can be obtained from https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/
For this project we need both Indian Cuisine and Himalayan Cuisine
Himanlayan Cuisince code is Himalayan Restaurant
52e81612bcbc57f1066b79fb
Indian Cusiene code is Indian Restaurant
4bf58dd8d48988d10f941735
Folium is used to map the clusters formed from the data base

  
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to get the data first for Manhattan neighborhood. 

Data was obtained using the below command. 
!wget -q -O 'newyork_data.json' https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.json
print('Data downloaded!')

Based on the latitude and longitude from the above Newyork data set, we can extract only the Manhattan neighborhood data. 

Borough	Neighborhood	Latitude	Longitude
0	Bronx	Wakefield	40.894705	-73.847201
1	Bronx	Co-op City	40.874294	-73.829939
2	Bronx	Eastchester	40.887556	-73.827806
3	Bronx	Fieldston	40.895437	-73.905643
4	Bronx	Riverdale	40.890834	-73.912585

We need to get all the Indian Cuisince details and Himalayan Cuisine details using the Foresquare account as below. 
#https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories
#Indian Cuisine = 4bf58dd8d48988d10f941735 
neighborhoods = neighborhoods[neighborhoods['Borough'] == 'Manhattan'].reset_index(drop=True)
newyork_Indian_cuisine = getNearbyIndianCuisines(names=neighborhoods['Neighborhood'], latitudes=neighborhoods['Latitude'], longitudes=neighborhoods['Longitude'], radius=1000, categoryIds='4bf58dd8d48988d10f941735')
newyork_Indian_cuisine.head()
newyork_Indian_cuisine.shape

#https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories
#Himalayan Cuisine = 52e81612bcbc57f1066b79fb
neighborhoods = neighborhoods[neighborhoods['Borough'] == 'Manhattan'].reset_index(drop=True)
newyork_Indian_cuisine2 = getNearbyIndianCuisines(names=neighborhoods['Neighborhood'], latitudes=neighborhoods['Latitude'], longitudes=neighborhoods['Longitude'], radius=1000, categoryIds='52e81612bcbc57f1066b79fb')
newyork_Indian_cuisine2.head()
newyork_Indian_cuisine2.shape

We can further perform data wrangling and clean up the above obtained data and then form cluster analysis on that data for further review. 

Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, 
any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The statistical testing and machine learning is not needed for this situation because the data was so clearly evident that there are two clusters
which can be good location to start the restaurants. Analyzing the data also has enough supporting data. So ML is not needed for this problem to come
to a recommendation. 

There are 39 unique locations that can be filtered based on the total Newyork Manhattan data. These 39 locations also have restaurant information to it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We analyzed four clusters above.

Cluster 1 has 13, Cluster has 16, Cluster 3 has 7 and Cluster 4 has 3 Indian Cuisines.

Clearly Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 are NOT suitable for starting a new Indian Cuisine as it is highly already crowded.

Cluster 3 and 4 has good options. Lets first analyze Cluster 3.

CLUSTER 3 ANALYSIS: Very interesting data. This cluster is flooded by Vegetarian restaurant, fast food place like food truck, 
burito place, chaat place, deli, diner, dosa place, a Himalayan cuisine and then food court. So this place clearly lacks few things 
like an authentic IndoChinese Cuisine, an Indian Pizza place, a grocery store to quickly supply materials for cuisine to run efficiently, 
authentic multi Indian dish serving cuisine where both vegetarian and non vegetarian food can be made available. We have 7 places 
covered in this cluster and pretty much all of them follow the same pattern of Indian cuisines due to close neighborhood boundary may be.

CLUSTER 4 ANALYSIS: This cluster covers little away from the other crowded Manhattan place. Gramercy, Carnegie Hill and Stuyvesant Town 
are the only places in this cluster where we find some Indian cuisine.

Secondly, Carnegie Hill has a grocery store near by to cater to all needs for a cuisine. The Carnegie Hill location is also flooded with 
North Indian, Dosa Place, Burito or Chaat place. There is no full fledged SOUTH INDIAN CUISINE in this location. So my brother's family 
can start a full South Indian Cuisine with attached fast food service in Carnegie Hill which also can cater its Sweet supplies to the near 
by grocery shop. In addition since this could be also catering to both fine dinning experience and a fast food drive thru, it has an edge over 
other locations and cuisines. Serving dishes that mainly focusses on south Indian delicacies, steam cooked dishes like momo (for 
Himanlayan cuisince flavor), a Chinese line of products would all completment and provide an edge in this location. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Conclude, based on this analysis, my brother's family can start an Indian cuisine which mainly focusses on catering fine 
dinning of authentic South Indian dishes, Steam cooked food, drive thru fast food, sweet product catering to the near by Grocery shop for sale 
in the Carnegie Hill location. Also this location is less impacted with public traffic movement and at the same time connected with public
transportation. The neighborhood is busy and highly populated to keep the business thriving. Any Manhattan school zone near by will also
benefit in addition as families who go around in the neighborhood can pick up to-go food from this restaurant. The presence of a grocery shop in 
the vicinity helps to keep the supply of raw materials always available for cooking needs. In addition, any manufactured sweets and frozen food
from the new Indian cuisince can be supplied for sale to the local grocery shop. Overall the location Carnegie Hill is providing good advantage 
and business prospect.
